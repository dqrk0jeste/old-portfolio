  <h1>About me</h1>
  <div>
    <p style="text-indent: 20px;">Hi! My name is Darko Nikolic and I'm a full-stack web developer. I have always been passionate about technology and computers, and recently stumbled upon software development as a fun new way to challenge myself and hopefully make a career of it.<br>
    <br>
    <p style="text-indent: 20px;">I'm still in high school, in my final year, but I'm pretty much done with it. Before I started with web development, I was (and I still am) really into math and physics. I was going to many competitions and won quite a lot of medals at national competitions. That granted me the opportunity to freely choose (practically) any university I want next year, with no entrance exam or anything. But I don't really want to go to university; I enjoy learning things on my own and at my own pace (which is MUCH faster than in any school I have attended) and I don't really like our education system.</p>
    <br>
    <p style="text-indent: 20px;">So right now I don't have any worries . I can focus on new things that interest me - and programming became one of them. As my high school profile is specialized in mathematics, physics and <em>programming</em>, I already had a really good foundation for it. That includes:</p>
    <br>
    <ul style="margin-left: 40px">
      <li>Two years of Java programming, including OOP and building GUIs using Java Swing.</li>
      <li>One year of programming in C</li>
      <li>A year-long course on computer architecture, history and assembly</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p style="text-indent: 20px;">I started with the basics: learned HTML, CSS and JavaScript, which I used for building this website. Then I learned Node.js for the backend and how to use databases, manually and with ORMs. On the frontend, I have learned Vue.js as my framework of choice to make my life easier.</p>
    <br>
    <p style="text-indent: 20px;">I like learning by directly going for something I am sure I cannot make at that moment. And then along the way I picked up all the things I didn't know. That has worked exceptionally well for me - I started only <strong>two months ago</strong> and have already made some pretty amazing projects I am proud of!</p>
    <br>
    <p style="text-indent: 20px;">Of course, there is so much more to learn. But I hope I will find a job soon, so I can say that all of this was worth it. And also to help my family financially! I am open to work preferably remotely, but hybrid work is also acceptable. I appreciate you reading this and hope to hear from you soon :) </p>
